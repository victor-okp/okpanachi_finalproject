#REVIEW CJT: I would remove the quarto and running code and instead add a title. Also I left a comment on subtitles and text from the quarto to use as advantage

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

#REVIEW CJT: I would put this code in a "code" folder. It makes it more organized to find it via GitHub.

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
# This data is a microbial water quality data collected in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. It was collected last summer and the aim was to assess the level of microbial water quality from different water sources in three districts of Dar es Salaam by tessting (#REVIEW CJT: testing) for the presence of coliforms and E.coli which serves as an indicator for fecal contamination in water sources. 
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
# My data-loading step demonstrates key skills from Week 2 (data import and vectors) and Week 3 (tidyverse basics). I use read_csv() to import the raw water-quality dataset into R and load the necessary tidyverse packages to prepare for further cleaning and analysis.

library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

#REVIEW CJT: dplyr and readr is already in the tidyverse, there is no reason to load this code again

water_raw <- read_csv("data_raw/water_tz_full.csv")
View(water_raw)

```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}

# This data-cleaning step demonstrates key skills from Week 3 (tidyverse basics), Week 6 (tidy data), and Week 7 (solving bigger problems). I use filter(), mutate(), and piping to create log-transformed microbial variables..

water_clean <- water_raw |>
  filter(!is.na(coliform_mpn_100mL)) |>   
  mutate(
    log_coliform = log10(coliform_mpn_100mL + 1),
    log_ecoli    = log10(e_coli_mpn_100mL + 1)
  )

glimpse(water_clean)


#REVIEW CJT: maybe showing the exact data column would be nice to use to display any changes
```

```{r}
#In the summary statistics, key concepts are from Week 3 (tidyverse basics), Week 4 (grouping data), and Week 7 (solving bigger problems). I use group_by() and summary() within a tidyverse pipeline to calculate mean coliform and E. coli concentrations across districts and water sources.

summary_microbes <- water_clean |>
  group_by(districts, water_source) |>
  summarise(
    mean_coliform = mean(coliform_mpn_100mL, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_ecoli    = mean(e_coli_mpn_100mL, na.rm = TRUE),
    n = n()
  )

summary_microbes

#REVIEW CJT: It would be nice to type your tables again so we can see them in the code instead of opening it up directly in the environment
```

```{r}
# I used boxplots to visualize microbial contamination patterns across districts and water sources, using concepts from Week 5 (data visualization), Week 3 (tidyverse basics), and Week 6 (tidy data principles). I used ggplot(), geom_boxplot(), log-scaled axes, and customized labels/themes to create clear visual summaries of coliform and E. coli contamination across districts and water sources.


#This project demonstrates key skills from Week 8 (reproducible workflows and project structure) by using an RStudio Project with subdirectories such as data_raw, data_clean, and outputs. I read data and save results using relative file paths (e.g., "data_raw/water_tz_full.csv" and "outputs/..."), and I scripted all data cleaning, analysis, and visualization in a Quarto document.
